# Addding Selenium Tests

## Overview
This repository contains a suite of Selenium tests designed to validate the functionality of a web application. Selenium is a powerful tool for automating browser interactions, and these tests are intended to ensure the robustness and correctness of the application under different scenarios.

## Prerequisites
Before running the Selenium tests, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

* **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed, as it is required for running JavaScript-based Selenium tests.

* **npm**: npm is the package manager for JavaScript. It is included with Node.js. Make sure you have a recent version installed. You can update npm using the following command:

```sh
npm install -g npm@latest
```

* WebDriver: WebDriver is a component of Selenium that provides a programming interface for controlling web browsers. Install the necessary WebDriver for your browser.

For Chrome:
```sh
npm install --save selenium-webdriver chromedriver
```

For Firefox:
```sh
npm install --save selenium-webdriver geckodriver
```

* Running the Tests
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the selenium-tests directory and install the project dependencies:

```sh
cd selenium-tests
npm install
```

3. Run Individual Test
To run an individual test, execute the following command, replacing <test-file> with the desired test file:

```sh
node tests/<test-file>
```
For example:
```sh
node tests/panelEditScreen-test.js
```

4. Run All Tests
To run all the tests, use the following command:

```sh
npm run test
```
This command will execute all the test files present in the tests directory.

## Writing Selenium Tests
If you are interested in writing additional Selenium tests or modifying existing ones, consider the following:

### Understanding Selenium WebDriver:
Familiarize yourself with Selenium WebDriver and its documentation: Selenium WebDriver Documentation

### Reviewing Existing Test Files:
Examine the structure and content of the existing test files in the tests directory to understand how tests are written using the Selenium WebDriver API.

### Using Assertions:
Leverage assertions from the testing framework (e.g., assert module in Node.js) to validate expected outcomes against actual results.

### Organizing Test Logic:
Structure your test logic into functions and use try/catch blocks for error handling.

### Interacting with Page Elements:
Use the findElement method to locate and interact with page elements (buttons, input fields, etc.). Familiarize yourself with various locators like By.id, By.className, etc.
